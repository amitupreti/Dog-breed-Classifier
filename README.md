### Here we implement CNN to predict dog breed and at the end make a function that will detect between human and a dog and show top 3 prediction.

In first part, We build CNN from Scratch with pytorch. I have tried to imitate the VGG16 model.

In the second part. We used VGG16 trained model for transfer learning to predict the dog breeds.
